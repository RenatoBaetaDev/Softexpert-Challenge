    Observartions: 
</h2>
<p>
    This is a very simple implementation using PHP and Angular.
    I do have multiple ideas to refactor and update the code, but due to time constraints, these implementations are not possible right now.
    I'd love to discuss the application as it stands and to show my thought process!
